# Usage

```sh
$ ovrw
$ ovrw project/dir
```

# Principles

1. Ovrw listen for updates in the folder
2. Ovrw finds all MDX files and creates a page for each file
3. Ovrw starts the website that shows all the pages
4. Ovrw updates the site when files are changed, added, or removed
5. Ovrw can export files to serve documentation as a static site

# Roadmap

DONE
1. Run a webpage rendered from one specific MDX file
2. Make page refresh whenever the file is changing

IN PROGRESS
3. Create a tool that will run such webpage for any specified MDX file

TODO
4. Make this tool serve the list of files
5. Add styles
